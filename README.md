# CS601_HW5_Zhu
## Intro
This is homework 5, which is a Promisse and JSON fetch assignment.

## How I go beyond
1. Use loop in the js file to dynamically create the table using the data from the json file.
2. Display the content using table and style the page with css.
3. An error message will be displayed on the page when the fetch fails after checking the response status (when it's not 200).

## How to run
1. Open index.html using your browser (I was using Chrome).
2. Click on the button to get the degree information of me.
